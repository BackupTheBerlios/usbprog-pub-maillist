<PRE>Hi,

As I have already mentioned in the forum, I am very much interested in 
starting development of an XSVF player for usbprog. I am currently having a 
look at some of the usbprog code in the svn and also at the XSVF Executor 
code from the Ethernut project. Up to now I think it shouldn't be too 
difficult to port the Ethernut code to usbprog. I have made up some ideas:

As XSVF instructions can become quite long I think it's best to send one 
instruction at a time via usb. This way usbprog can also send back 
information to the player software running on the computer wether the current 
XSVF instruction was successful or not.

Is it correct that a USB packet has a maximum payload size of 1023 bytes in 
our case, so that XSVF instructions of nearly 1kB could be supported without 
fragmentation? I think that should be enough for the beginning, as we only 
have 2kB static RAM anyway.

Has anyone any other suggestions?

Regards
Sven
