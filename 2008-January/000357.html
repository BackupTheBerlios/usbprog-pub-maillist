As far as I'm concerned, the kernel I've been running was 2.6.22.11 (now 
2.6.22.15) from kernel.org with only linux-vserver patched (which 
shouldn't have any effect) (the distro being Debian as already 
mentioned, but that shouldn't matter).

The usb driver has been uhci_hcd when I tried in my last mail, now I've 
tried again with ohci_hcd (possibly on my other usb pci card), with the 
same outcome.

Yes, I'm glad to see a solution on the horizon.

The problem is, I don't have a programmer for the ATMega / AVR to be 
able to flash the fixed firmware.

In our group, some people are using a product with the Atmel ATmega 
128L, would programmers for that chip be usable for flashing the usbprog 
chip? If so, I could ask around whether someone has one to lend me. 
Would the plug of such programmers match the usbprog?

If there's no luck with that, Benedikt, could I send you the usbprog 
back for reprogramming? I could also send you a linux live cd for 
checking whether it works. If it doesn't, we could wait for more info by 
Michael.

(Alternatively someone could also temporarily send me a programmer for 
the usbprog, so I could reflash/test it myself; I should note though 
that I'm quite busy and will not have much time for further debugging of 
the usb problems if the fix doesn't work.)

Thanks,
Christian.
