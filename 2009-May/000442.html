<PRE>Hello,

I've worked on an I2C firmware + kernel module for the usbprog, I think you
might be interested.

Here is the repost of the message I've put on the forum.
Don't hesitate to comment the code and the solution !

&gt;<i> I wrote an I2C firmware + a kernel module which , after much grey hair, finally work.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently using it with lm-sensors to get temperature from an lm76.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's developed using the current trunk, so I can provide a patch.
</I>&gt;<i> The kernel module is currently working on 2.6.26, not tried on other versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the short story, I first started to check the usbprogI2C, but it was incomplete and no kernel module existed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I went for the i2c-tiny, with the secret goal to emulate its behavior so no other kernel module would be necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> It went well until I found out that the usbn904 cannot accept controls endpoints transactions of more than 8 bytes. It was a show-stopper because the i2c-tiny-usb uses control endpoint exclusively, adding the data at the end of the packet.
</I>&gt;<i> After trying, and failing, to emulate this behavior with the usbn904, I finally gave up and made a new kernel module that uses bulk endpoints, keeping more or less the same protocol. (I know at this point I could have used the original &quot;usbprogI2C&quot; protocol, but after all this crawl I was kind of familiar with the i2c-tiny-usb one).
</I>&gt;<i> I used the serial port on the usbprog extensively for debugging, but all the debug info is #defined away in the patch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pin SCL is PB5 (pin1), SDA is PB1 (pin 6), it's 5V only , of course, unless you have the 3.3V adapter.
</I>&gt;<i> The led blink when a request is done (either read or write).
</I>&gt;<i> Everything is GPL, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the patch is here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://obcd.dynalias.org/repo/">http://obcd.dynalias.org/repo/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can also have a look at the simpleport_ob.patch file, which is a small improvement for the simpleport firmware. (it add the GETPORTDIR instruction to get the direction of all pins at once - I found that useful, in a program which might restart sometime, it avoid changing pin direction at startup, which was critical in my application).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to criticize the code, It's a first shot (I got it working today) so I know there must be some problems. I'm willing to follow any advice you may have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One &quot;bug&quot; I did not take care of at all is the speed of the transaction: I still have to make the actual speed measurement and change the delay algorithm accordingly. For now is it completely untouched from i2c-tiny-usb. I just know it must be &lt; 400Khz since my LM76 doe not work above this speed....

People in the embedded space don't do prototypes. They hack something until it
works, then it's done.

Always code as if the person who will maintain your code is a maniac serial
killer that knows where you live
